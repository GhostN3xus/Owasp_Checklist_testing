    title: "Broken Object Level Authorization"
    description: "Object level authorization flaws allow attackers to bypass authorization checks."
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    cweId: "CWE-639"
    bodyMd: |
      ## Definition
      Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR) occurs when APIs don't properly verify that users can only access their own objects.

      ## Risk
      - Unauthorized data access
      - Privacy violations
      - Data manipulation/deletion
      - Mass data exposure

      ## Verification
      - Manipulate object IDs in requests (user_id, document_id, etc.)
      - Test with different user accounts
      - Check if UUID/GUID prevents enumeration
      - Verify authorization on every object access
