    title: "Broken Access Control"
    description: "Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions."
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    cweId: "CWE-639"
    bodyMd: |
      ## Definition
      Broken access control occurs when users can act outside of their intended permissions. This includes:
      - Users can view, edit, or delete resources they shouldn't have access to
      - Direct references to objects without proper authorization checks
      - Missing or ineffective access controls on sensitive functionality
      
      ## Risk
      - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
      - Data breach and privacy violations
      - System compromise
      - Business impact and regulatory fines
      
      ## Verification
      - Test changing user IDs in URLs (IDOR)
      - Verify permission checks on all endpoints
      - Test role-based access restrictions
      - Check for missing authentication on sensitive functions

    title: "Cryptographic Failures"
    description: "Failure to adequately protect sensitive data in transit and at rest."
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    cweId: "CWE-327"
    bodyMd: |
      ## Definition
      Cryptographic failures involve issues such as:
      - Transmitting sensitive data in cleartext
      - Using weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms
      - Inadequate encryption key management
      - Missing TLS/SSL in communication
      
      ## Risk
      - Data interception and exposure
      - Loss of confidentiality and integrity
      - Regulatory compliance violations
      
      ## Verification
      - Check for HTTPS/TLS on all pages
      - Verify strong encryption algorithms (AES-256)
      - Test for weak cryptography implementations
      - Check encryption key storage and rotation

    title: "Injection"
    description: "Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to code interpreter."
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    cweId: "CWE-89"
    bodyMd: |
      ## Definition
      Injection vulnerabilities include:
      - SQL Injection
      - LDAP Injection
      - OS Command Injection
      - Template Injection
      - Expression Language Injection
      
      ## Risk
      - Unauthorized data access
      - Data modification or deletion
      - System compromise
      - Denial of service
      
      ## Verification
      - Test all input fields with SQL injection payloads
      - Verify prepared statements usage
      - Test for command injection vectors
      - Check for proper input validation and escaping
